<p>
  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to
  explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal
  information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
  personal information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have
      given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a
      specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more
      about <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information
      when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate
      business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and
      fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal
      information for some of the purposes described in order to:
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>

      retain users

      <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where
      we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such
      as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise
      or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in
      litigation in which we are involved.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we
      believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital
      interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats
      to the safety of any person.

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong
    ><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></strong

</p>
<p>
  We may process your information if you have given us specific permission
  (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
  purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied
  consent). You can <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdraw your consent</a> at any
  time.
</p>
<p>
  In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to
  process your information without your consent, including, for example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent
      cannot be obtained in a timely way
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</p></li>
  <li><p>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary
      to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with
      next of kin

    <p>
      If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or
      may be victim of financial abuse
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
      compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
      collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of
      an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order,
      or rules of the court relating to the production of records
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment,
      business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes
      for which the information was produced
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary

  We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers,
  contractors, or agents (&quot;<strong>third parties</strong>&quot;) who
  perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such
  information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third
  parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This

  applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such
  third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the
  use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of
  a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply
  an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you
  provide to any third-party websites. Any data collected by third parties is
  not covered by this Privacy Notice. We are not responsible for the content or
  privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including
  other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the
  Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact
  them directly to respond to your questions.
</p>
<h4 id="6-do-we-use-cookies-and-other-tracking-technologies-">
  6. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
</h4>
<p>
  We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and
  pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online
  tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent
  crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site
  functions.
</p>
<p>
  We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking
  technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help
  manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests,
  or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication
  preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to
  provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests
  which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.
</p>
<p>
  To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a
  &quot;sale&quot;/&quot;sharing&quot; (which includes targeted advertising, as
  defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt
  out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described
  below under section &quot;<a href="#uslaws"

<p>
  We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for
  the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period
  is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
  requirements).
</p>
<p>
  When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
  information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this
  is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
  stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
  information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
  possible.
</p>
<h4 id="8-how-do-we-keep-your-information-safe-">
  8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
</h4>
<p>
  We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
  security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information
  we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
  information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
  storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise
  or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties
  will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal,
  or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
  personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
  Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
  secure environment.

  years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the
  Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or
  guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the
  Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years
  of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
  measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of
  any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us

<h4 id="11-controls-for-do-not-track-features">
  11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
</h4>
<p>
  Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
  include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate
  to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
  activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology
  standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
  such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
  mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
  online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
  the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
  this Privacy Notice.
</p>
<p>
  California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT
  signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for
  recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
